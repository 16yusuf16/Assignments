##  Code Assignment
####  You work in an e-commerce platform as a software engineer. A new campaign module which manipulates prices according to demand, is brought to you as an #### #### important business requirement.
#### ● You have products, orders and campaigns in your domain.
#### ● You create a product with product code, price and stock.
#### ● You create an order with product code and quantity. Price can be assumed the current price of product at that moment.
#### ● You create a campaign with a name, a product code, duration, price manipulation limit and target sales count.
#### ○ Campaign starts after creating and ends after given duration.
#### ○ Duration is given in hours.
#### ○ A price manipulation limit is the maximum percentage that you can increase or decrease the price of product according to demand.
#### ○ Target sales count is the product quantity you want to sell during the campaign.
#### ● You will simulate time in your system. Time will start with 00:00 and it will be increased by you in any amount of hour.
#### ● You are free to design your algorithm for how to calculate demand and how to increase and decrease the price during the campaign.
#### You will have scenario files in the context of this assignment (Sample scenario files are sent you along with this assignment document. Please use them to see #### if your program is running as expected).
#### ● Scenario files have commands for the operations defined in business requirements.
#### ● Your program will read scenario file and produce output for each command.
#### ● You are free to choose the programming language (e.g. C#, Java, C++, Go)
#### The table given below defines all commands which should be recognized by your system.
####    Command
####    What it does
####  create_product PRODUCTCODE PRICE STOCK
#### get_product_info PRODUCTCODE create_order PRODUCTCODE QUANTITY
#### create_campaign NAME PRODUCTCODE DURATION PMLIMIT TARGETSALESCOUNT
#### get_campaign_info NAME increase_time HOUR
#### Creates product in your system with given product information.
#### Prints product information for given product code. Creates order in your system with given information.
#### Creates campaign in your system with given information
#### Prints campaign information for given campaign name Increases time in your system.
           ####  The table given below shows sample input and outputs for all possible commands in your system (Given outputs assumes commands are executed successfully)

#### Code should run as expected.
#### Code Quality (Clean Code, SOLID, Applying Patterns “if necessary”, and other Software Craftsmanship techniques)
####  Readability
#### Unit testing. TDD approach will be favored.
#### Packaging (how easy it is to run the code)
#### Domain Modeling
